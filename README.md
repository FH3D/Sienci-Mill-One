# Sienci-Mill-One
The Sienci Mill One is an open source machine made by Sienci Labs that turns your ideas into reality by carving 3D objects from materials like wood, metal, plastic, foam, and PCB boards. This was done in order to contribute toward the availability of online resources for creating and sharing hardware, software, and electronics designs pertaining to rapid prototyping technologies. As an open-source product, the Mill One itself already contains existing open-source products, making additional contributions in the realm of hardware, software, and electronics.
